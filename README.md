# Arduino Inertial Navigation Project

This project is an implementation of a simple Inertial Navigation system as described by Woodman in this [article](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-696.pdf) with rotation matrices. It only uses the integrated accelerometer and gyroscope of the Arduino Nano BLE 33. And no error correction is made. For this reason the model diverges within a few seconds and has no pratical use other than being a proof of concept.

## Requirements

The arduino library Arduino\_LSM9DS1 https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino\_LSM9DS1

## Usage

Todo
